DistroHub is not a copy or a replacement for the already mentioned WatchDistro.com, but it is a modern version of the same, with very few services at the beginning. WatchDistro offers many more search options and much more information related to packages as well as linux distributions. DistroHub only offers something basic, such as a short description of the distribution itself, a link to the distribution site, as well as a couple of screenshots of the distribution itself.",

Lately (especially over the past year), I keep coming across these portfolio sites on r/webdev — some of them are _really_ well done. Just clean, simple, and professional — and they immediately give off the vibe that a solid developer is behind them.

But then there’s the _other_ side of the coin — people building portfolios that look like full-blown operating systems??? Or interactive VSCode editors?? Terminals???
Like... what the hell?
Do people seriously forget that HR folks are the ones opening these sites too? These aren’t developers reviewing your stuff — they don’t have time (or patience) to figure out how to “navigate” your portfolio just to find your GitHub or read a description.

HR wants everything laid out _clearly_ and _simply_. A portfolio that looks like a damn OS is just making their life harder.
If you're proud of that crazy terminal/VSCode/OS concept — cool, put it as one of your _projects_. But don’t make it your _main_ portfolio. It’s just unnecessary friction.

When someone’s hiring and checking your work, they want to get to the info _fast_. A nice, short animation? Totally fine.
But a whole-ass operating system? On _mobile_, too?? Or VSCode as a portfolio?? Come on, man.
